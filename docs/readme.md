Quickly generate a test site full of random users, posts, comments, tags and images.


## Description

From a fresh install of WordPress, use the admin page in Tools->**Content Generator** to add test users, populate the Media Library with example images, an additional custom post type and custom taxonomies, generate as many test "_Lorem Ipsum_" posts as you want, and then add comments to those posts.

Each of those "_Lorem Ipsum_" posts will be randomly tagged, categorised, and can be assigned one of the test images as its Featured Image.

This plugin is aimed at those of us who need to test plugins and themes on a regular basis, but it would serve for anyone to get a feel of how their site will look when it's full of content.


### Workflow

All the steps are optional, and can be repeated as much as you want, depending on how much of your site you want to test.

However, if you want (eg) your test _Posts_ to appear to have been written by different people, then you need to add the _Users_ beforehand - no individual step will "backfill" preceeding ones automatically.

1. Add some _Users_
2. Download some _Images_
3. Enable the _Custom Post Type_ / _Custom Taxonomies_
4. Add some _Taxonomy_ terms
5. Generate some test _Posts_
6. Add the _Comments_
7. Done. Go check your site looks and behaves how you think it should.


## Screenshots

1. Generating new test _Posts_.
2. An example of the output using the *Polite* theme.
3. Create any role of user in the _Users_ screen.
4. Adding _Images_ to your Media Library.
5. The _Custom Post Type_ and _Custom Taxonomies_ can be enabled separately.
6. Add test terms to all of your _Taxonomies_.
7. Fill out your frontend by adding _Comments_ to your content.
